## Mobile web app for John Colins bar in SF

This web app was made as a mock demo to introduce the exciting possibilities of [prismic.io](https://prismic.io) in the native mobile web environment.

This is a mock example, made as a webapp; it was made with Rails, JQuery Mobile, and [JQuery Mobile Flat UI Theme](http://ququplay.github.io/jquery-mobile-flat-ui-theme/).

It was started from the [prismic.io rails starter kit](https://github.com/prismicio/ruby-rails-starter).

### What should I use this for?

For nothing. Seriously.

This was made for a single demo given on Monday December 2nd 2013 in John Colins bar, for the [DrinksOnTap meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DrinksOnTapSF/).

It follows some best practice, but for the sake of the demo, bypasses some. It isn't even really an interesting example content-wise. Also, it was formatted to be hosted by Heroku. If you want to see some code made with best practice and great examples, you should check out [the prismic.io developer portal's webpage dedicated to Rails](https://developers.prismic.io/technologies/UjBh6MuvzeMJvE4m/ruby).
